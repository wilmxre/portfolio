        frontend products with a clean User Interface and a great User Experience. I'm an open minded
        student who likes to learn about new technologies and try them out instantly after grasping the concept of it.
        Currently I'm getting introduced to working with frameworks, so I can build more complex and scalable projects
        in the future.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is László Kocsis, or you may also know me by my alias, @wilmxre, and I am a 21
        years old
        Informatics Student
        from
        Târgu Mureș, Romania, who loves creating things that live on the Internet.</p>
      <p>My interest in Web Development started back in 2015-2016, when I was experimenting and playing around with
        basic
        websites and I was fascinated by the fact that you can build something beautiful with the help of a few lines of
        code.</p>
      <p>Fast-forward to 2022, I decided that I want to pursue this branch of the industry and I dived into the world of
        Web Development more seriously, learning every day about it with lots of practice.</p>
      <p>Currently I am building my projects with HTML, CSS and JavaScript using Version Control with <a
          href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>. As an
        autodidact, I am extremely eager to learn anything that helps expanding my knowledge so I started to
        get into <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React.js</a> and I want to
        learn <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>/<a href="https://nodejs.org/"
          target="_blank">Node.js</a> in the future, but I'm also open to different technologies.</p>
      <p>I am a very curious and self-motivated person, with a lot of attention to details in design and I always work
        towards achieving the best possible result on each project that I'm involved in.</p>
